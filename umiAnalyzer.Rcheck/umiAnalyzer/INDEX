betaNLL                 Calculates the negative log likelihood for the
                        beta distribution.
callVariants            Calculate variant p-values using
                        permutation-based testing. A prior is fitted to
                        model the background error using maximum
                        likelihood estimation of a beta distribution.
                        The maximum likelihood estimate of the beta
                        distribution is then used to define the shape
                        of a beta-binomial distribution used to
                        estimate variant P-Values. This can be
                        interpreted as a probability for a variant to
                        not have arisen by chance

filterUMIobject         Method for filtering UMIexperiment and sample
                        objects

importDesign            Import experimental design meta data such as
                        replicates, treatments, categorical variables.
mergeTechnicalReplicates
                        A function to merge replicates in UMIexperiment
                        object. This will result in a merged data set
                        accessible from the UMIexperiment object using
                        merged.data. This is meant to provide
                        statistical information across multiple
                        replicates. If you want to merge multiple
                        sequencing runs of the sample into a single
                        sample using the collapseReplicates function
                        instead.
parseBamFiles           function to parse bam files
readBamFile             Method for reading bam files
simsen                  UMIexperiment data generated with SiMSen-Seq
viz_Merged_data         Generate Amplicon plots
viz_Normalization       Plot coverage before and after normalization
