\title{A function to merge replicates in UMIexperiment object. This will result in a merged data set
accessible from the UMIexperiment object using merged.data. This is meant to provide statistical
information across multiple replicates. If you want to merge multiple sequencing runs of the
sample into a single sample using the collapseReplicates function instead.}
