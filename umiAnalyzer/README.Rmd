# umiAnalyzer

umiAnalyzer provides tools for analyzing umierrorcorrect output. 

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(umiAnalyzer)

main = "/Path_to_Project"

sample.names <- list.dirs(path = main, full.names = FALSE, recursive = FALSE)

exp1 <- create.UMIexperiment(experiment.name = "exp1",
                             main.dir = main,
                             dir.names = sample.names)

exp1 <- filterUMIobject(exp1)

```
